# BigSurIcons
Rounded edge Icons for Big Sur. Will keep adding to the collection.

With the release of macOS Big Sur, Apple has changed the application theme to rounded-edges like iOS apps. I am uploading some of my icons I have made based upon the original that matches the new theme. I will keep adding newer icons, both .icns and .png versions as I make them. I also submit these icons to https://macosicons.com/. My icons are absolutley free to use, share them with whomever you want, just don't claim you made it. A link to my github is preferable. Thanks, and enjoy the uniformity on your dock!
